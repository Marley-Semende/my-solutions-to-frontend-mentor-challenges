## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const calculateAge = () => {
  let today = new Date();

  // parse formInput values
  let year = parseInt(formInput[2].value, 10);
  let month = parseInt(formInput[1].value, 10);
  let day = parseInt(formInput[0].value, 10);
  let birthDate = new Date(year, month - 1, day);

  let ageInMilliseconds = today - birthDate;
  let years = Math.floor(ageInMilliseconds / (365.25 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000));
  let months = Math.floor(
    (ageInMilliseconds % (365.25 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000)) /
      (30.44 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000)
  );
  let days = Math.floor(
    (ageInMilliseconds % (30.44 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000)) / (24 * 60 * 60 * 1000)
  );
};
```
